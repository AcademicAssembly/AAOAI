<dc:description>The growing significance of companies that conduct international business at or near their funding has been critically challenging previous incremental models of international expansion. This thesis aims to cross-compare, by means of a multiple-case study, eight Portuguese start-ups among themselves and with the theoretical concept of born global firms versus traditional ones. This work project finds that: (1) active entrepreneurs with global vision from inception are essential for the implementation of international strategies; (2) only formal network plays a key role for successful internationalization and (3) inimitable sources of value creation, niche-focused strategies and unique intangible assets are also crucial.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this research is to recommend a brand identity for Joãozinho brand. This one is linked with the new pediatric hospital of Hospital de São João do Porto and with the fundraising project named “Um Lugar para o Joãozinho”. For this, a 360º market research, with the most important stakeholders, was conducted. The aim was to comprehend how children perceived the brand’s mascot (Joãozinho), what characteristics of a pediatric service parents look for, what makes companies help this project (either through sponsorship agreements or other means of financial aid) and what do brand builders want for the brand.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Management from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>Purpose: This work project should be inevitably deemed as a practical approach to a marketing problem; “How to engage low category users through the social media – the case of the make-up sector in Portugal”.&#13;
Design/methodology/approach: Online structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews were used. The questionnaire was answered by 110 women aged from 15 to 45 years old and the interviews were conducted with 14 women of the same age. The interviews provided key insights for the questionnaire formulation.&#13;
Findings: Women are poorly informed on make-up properties and characteristics, feeling a genuine concern in regard to this subject. Lack of time, occasional usage and skin damage are the main barriers for make-up usage by low category users. Overcoming these aspects pass by demystifying the association of make-up with skin damage and emphasise the functional and emotional benefits of make-up. Further, brands need to create contents more consumer-oriented and ask directly to fans/followers suggestions and other insights. Resort to Portuguese “common” women for greater empathy in campaigns, promote online meetings between followers and make-up professionals on social media; and finally take advantage of the hybrid condition of Facebook, which incorporates multiple forms of content presentation, including videos, the most appealing format of make-up presentation for women.&#13;
Research limitations/implications: Further studies addressing this topic, by using larger samples and study of specific make-up brands and campaign programs, over social media to reach a solid growth potential of make-up market evidences in Portugal.&#13;
Originality/ value: Make-up brands are emphasising their interest in linking social media and marketing their promotional mix around social marketing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Economics from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>This paper studies the existing price linkage between generics and branded pharmaceuticals, in which the generic price must be a fraction of the latter. Using a vertical differentiation model, we look at the market equilibrium, the effects on the incentives for the brand producer to develop new products, and the possibility of predation by the brand producer over the generic firm. We find that the price linkage increases prices compared to no indexation and it may increase the incentives for the brand producer to expand its set of products. When prices are freely set, the branded firm may also want to expand a new product with a higher quality, but will prefer to remove the original one from the market. Predation may equally occur in both schemes but the price linkage may give fewer incentives for the branded firm to predate while compensating losses with a new drug.</dc:description>

<dc:description>h3 is a Portuguese firm competing in the fast food market with a hamburger gourmet&#13;
concept. The firm is now a strong player in Portugal (39 stores); Poland, Warsaw (1&#13;
store); Spain, Madrid (1 store) and Brazil, São Paulo (2 stores). As a result of their&#13;
successes in the domestic market, internationalization was a natural step. One of the&#13;
major challenges the firm faces is the model to use in expanding into the Brazilian&#13;
market. The aim of this project is to suggest to the firm the best approach for h3 in their&#13;
expansion into Brazil. In order to assess the best mode of entry into new markets within&#13;
Brazil, an in depth analysis of the h3 success performance in Portugal is necessary. By&#13;
analyzing the Brazilian fast food market, we can see to what extent these markets&#13;
achieve and do not achieve parity. As we shall see from the analysis, expansion is&#13;
completely viable within the Brazilian market, to the states of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and&#13;
Estado Federal. Furthermore, the existing model h3 uses in its current Brazilian stores,&#13;
that is, a joint venture model with h3 and its Brazilian partners as the master franchiser,&#13;
will be the most successful route to rapid expansion in the region and in ensuring that&#13;
competitors do not steal the concept h3 has pioneered.</dc:description>

Área de Especialização em Comunicação Estratégica</dc:description>
<dc:description>A presente dissertação tem como objetivo perceber o papel da comunicação&#13;
estratégica no contexto da luta contra o terrorismo. O terrorismo é considerado como&#13;
sendo a principal ameaça securitária contemporânea e a Organização do Atlântico Norte&#13;
(NATO) tem um papel fundamental no desenvolvimento dos esforços de combate e&#13;
prevenção dessa ameaça no seio da comunidade internacional.&#13;
As últimas décadas foram férteis em transformações que obrigaram a uma&#13;
profunda e rápida adaptação ao novo ambiente. Os media juntaram-se ao rol de atores&#13;
políticos relevantes, aqueles que têm o poder de influenciar decisões e ações,&#13;
remodelando assim a realidade. Com a internet surgem novos fenómenos como as redes&#13;
sociais que democratizam o espaço mediático e levam à desaparição das fronteiras&#13;
dando origem àquilo a que se tem chamado uma “opinião pública mundial” que exige&#13;
ser ouvida e cujo “controlo” ou “influência” é visado por entidades tais como Estados,&#13;
organizações ou empresas. Estes novos espaços de oportunidades são solo fértil para o&#13;
aparecimento de novos atores que, tomando partido do desaparecimento de fronteiras,&#13;
utilizam-nos para transmitirem a sua mensagem e lutarem eles próprios pela influência&#13;
da opinião pública. Os grupos terroristas, como a al-Qaeda, são utilizadores experientes&#13;
destes espaços.&#13;
Em suma, a nossa tese consiste em afirmar que aquilo que está em causa hoje&#13;
em dia é não só uma guerra no sentido tradicional do termo como também um conflito&#13;
de interpretações. Para fazer face a este conflito e poder ganhá-lo, o que significará&#13;
ganhar “os corações e as mentes” do público, a comunicação de organizações como a&#13;
NATO terá de ocupar um lugar cimeiro na estratégia prosseguida como esforço&#13;
fundamental para o sucesso da missão.&#13;
Neste sentido, sobretudo a partir de 2009, data da adopção do conceito pela&#13;
NATO, a comunicação estratégica tem sido debatida enquanto elemento fundamental&#13;
para o sucesso não só das missões da aliança como da própria sobrevivência da organização. O exemplo do Afeganistão (tal como o dos EUA no Iraque) abriu a porta&#13;
ao debate sobre a forma como a NATO se está a adaptar ao novo ambiente estratégico,&#13;
no qual a perceção dos públicos é um elemento fundamental para o sucesso de qualquer&#13;
missão. Na NATO, o esforço pela influência das percepções, atitudes e comportamentos&#13;
das várias audiências (domésticas, parceiras/inimigas e locais) tem ao seu dispor vários&#13;
instrumentos de comunicação coordenados de acordo com um plano elaborado sob a&#13;
alçada da comunicação estratégica.&#13;
Assim, a NATO (tal como outras organizações tradicionais) vê-se obrigada a&#13;
adotar novas abordagens adaptadas ao novo ambiente securitário e mediático e ao novo&#13;
tipo de ameaças. Essa adaptação de métodos e procedimentos obriga, por sua vez, ao&#13;
repensar da estrutura organizacional tradicional que se tornou obsoleta e desadequada à&#13;
nova realidade. Para se manter como um ator importante do plano securitário atual e&#13;
futuro, argumentamos que a aliança tem de transformar a sua estrutura tradicionalmente&#13;
hierárquica e burocratizada, a qual deverá dar lugar a uma estrutura mais flexível.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study examined user-generated (UG) advertising in the context of social media&#13;
networks. The focus was on how people, whether an expert in the area, a non-expert or a&#13;
friend, influence the reader of the advertisement. Furthermore, the study analyzed how the&#13;
certainty level of the UG advertisement influences the person viewing the ad.&#13;
The study showed that for the friend source a high certainty message was more&#13;
persuasive. However, regarding the certainty no significant results were found for the expert&#13;
and non-expert. Further, the type of the source had a considerable impact on persuasion.&#13;
Someone that we personally know (e.g., a friend) was rated most positive for all analyzes&#13;
variables. This shows that with the rising usage of social media there are great opportunities&#13;
for new effective advertising strategies that could include a new type of an endorser – friends.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Research literature and regulators are unconditional in pointing the disclosure of operating cash flow through direct method a section of unique information. Besides the intuitive facet, it is also consistent in forecasting future operating cash flows and a cohesive piece to financial statement puzzle. Bearing this in mind, I produce an analysis on the usefulness and predictive ability on the disclosure of gross cash receipts and payments over the disclosure of reconciliation between net income and accruals for two markets with special features, Portugal and Spain. Results validate the usefulness of direct method format in predicting future operating cash flow.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis analyzes and proposes the internationalization strategy of the Portuguese company Science4you to the United Kingdom focusing on its core business, educational scientific toys development. Science4you is a profitable and recently formed company that has already established international operations and is seeking to increase its external revenue streams by reaching other countries.&#13;
The study scrutinizes the internal environmental context by examining the company history, objectives, operations functioning, industry key drivers and its competitive assessment. In view of the fact that Science4you has been considering the hypothesis of expanding its operations to the United Kingdom, this country was the main target of the study research. Nevertheless, the British toy market attractiveness was analyzed and compared to other potential candidates confirming that the United Kingdom represents a prosperous expansion opportunity. Furthermore a country macro-environmental and a British toy sector analysis were performed, allowing a detailed proposal of the implementation plan regarding the mode of entry, resources needed and the best way to explore the company capabilities in the United Kingdom, namely through the establishment of a direct exporting strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This report aims to study the evolution of the Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP) over the course of the last years. With the 2007 financial crisis many fundamental relationships changed, and CIP was not an exception. To infer whether or not this was&#13;
an isolate event, the behaviour of the CIP during the European Sovereign debt crisis was&#13;
studied. Currency pairs such as EURUSD showed significant CIP deviations during&#13;
both crises. This work shows that currently, spreads are mostly explained by counterparty risk and market sentiment factors, which are extremely different factors from the ones explaining the spread during 2003-06.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research investigated Portuguese Hospitals’ Corporate Social Responsibility reporting practices, by analyzing Hospitals’ Annual Reports and websites. The main hospital stakeholders were presented and activities pertaining to each group included. Overall, it appears that there is a lack of strategic CSR reporting on both private and public hospitals. Hospital managers should include stakeholders in their CSR strategy and aim it at shared value creation. Hospitals need to build a stronger relationship with the community and reformulate CSR reporting practices to ensure that the reporting is timely, complete and relevant and is easily accessible by interested parties.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 2007, the UK government commissioned the Energy Demand Research Project to conduct a large scale experiment of smart metering technologies to test the impacts from many different forms of feedback to residential consumers. A full evaluation of the results was completed in 2011.&#13;
In Portugal, EDP is also conducting smart meter trials in a project called InovCity in the city of Évora whose results will be evaluated during 2012. In this work, the case of Great Britain is studied as a reference on how an evaluation of trial results should be conducted. I also discuss potential limitations of the experiments, implications for national roll-out decisions, and finally draw some lessons that can be applied to the Portuguese case.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There is a growing interest in social impact assessment across the private, the public and the nonprofit sector. However, there is still limited academic research produced in this area, particularly in what concerns to the application of the Social Return of Investment (SROI) methodology. The goal of this Work Project is to give an overview of the social impact measurement literature and apply the Social Return on Investment, a flagship methodology to measure impact, to the specific case of the Social Innovation Hub (SIH). The findings suggest that each 1€ invested on the SIH generates 1,21€ in terms of social value. While this value seems very appealing to use, there are some risks in monetizing impact in such way, mainly due to the lack of reliable data available for benchmarking purposes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Financial institutions are turning their attentions to lean methodology. Strong competitive financial markets demand that organizations search for new ways to achieve competitive advantage. Lean thinking proposes a new method to reach high efficiency: the kaizen approach, which advocates a change in the mind set of all stakeholders towards continuous improvement. In this work project is represented the lean methodology applied at the bank, from a bottom-up spirit, as well as the evaluation of the benefits and the achievement of the proposed goals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Economics from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>This project tries to assess whether hospitals react to random demand pressure by discharging patients earlier than expected. As a matter of fact, combining an unpredictable demand for medical services with limited and, to some extent, fixed medical resources, generates strong incentives to discharge patients earlier than expected when demand is high - increasing the risk of readmission and decreasing the benefit from treatment. This work was conducted as a way to determine whether those incentives actually affect discharging decisions. Analysis of Portuguese hospitals data shows that hospital utilization levels at the time of admission, prior to the admission and post admission do have a negative impact over the length of stay in hospital, although this impact is quantitatively irrelevant. More than that, larger utilization levels have a positive impact over the probability of being discharged at certain days of the week, indicating that an early discharges problem may exist.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Despite the fact that public medical care has being heavily subsidized through a&#13;
statutory national health system there has been a growing number of people who opt to&#13;
enroll in extra private coverage. Using a two part model to infer the insurance decision&#13;
and subsequent amount of insurance chosen we found out that people’s decision over&#13;
private health coverage is not related with their health. The pattern of consumption of&#13;
medical care that is not available in the public sector and a good socio economic&#13;
background were found significant modeling the demand for private health insurance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This Work Project analyzes the internationalization strategy of Shoes Closet, a Portuguese footwear SME, to the United Kingdom. It was based on fundamental&#13;
support information provided by the company’s founder, on desk research and on&#13;
market research. It tackles the domestic market, with a comprehensive internal and&#13;
market scanning. It also analyses the British market, justifying the country choice and studying the competitive environment. Subsequently, this Work Project concludes that it is necessary to consider Portugal as a tactical market, implementing a deep change to foster the sustainable development of the company, to enter in the British market&#13;
afterwards.</dc:description>

<dc:description>I study the influence of not-for-profit entities in companies, through shareholders proposals in the U.S. largest companies. This paper analyzes the not-for-profit entities involved, the issues addressed by the proposals and the financial characteristics of target companies, as well as market reactions and voting outcomes. Results indicate that not-for-profit entities tend to target companies with higher profitability and value more frequently than general investors. Furthermore, the voting outcome is influenced by insider ownership and types of proposals. Finally, market reactions change with profitability, leverage, ownership structure and types of proposals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work project introduces the performance of the algorithm Dynamic Time Warping amidst trading strategies in the financial markets. The employed procedure allows the comparison between any two sequences of data with different time lengths. Different features for the method were implemented, although those did not improve its promptness or accuracy in the outcomes obtained. Two potential investment strategies are presented within this theme. One yielded satisfactory outcomes whilst the other resulted in inconsistent values. The results point to the possible existence of patterns in the Equity Indexes’ behaviour, as well as their distortion across the time axis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Capital Requirements have been gaining importance in the current macroeconomic and financial environment and Portugal is no exception. Nonetheless, despite the several media articles on this subject, the associations with Loan Market Conditions, namely availability and pricing are still unstudied. Thus, this project adds to the existing literature a characterization of Portuguese four biggest banks on capital reporting and requirements fulfillment. It is concluded that banks under analysis need to increase capital and that there is an association between the variables under study: Share Capital is negatively correlated with Credit Volume, and it is positively correlated with Net Commercial Income.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper extends the model of Spolaore (2004) about adjustments in di erent government systems for the context of  scal adjustments and sovereign default. We introduce asymmetry between groups in income and preferences towards fiscal reforms. Default affects differently each group and becomes a possibility if reforms are not enacted after public finance solvency shocks,&#13;
in influencing the political game according to its likelihood. With the extensions,&#13;
new situations which were not possible with the previous framework arise.&#13;
After the exposition of the model, the Argentine default in 2001 provides an&#13;
example of the political conflicts addressed by the model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work project studies the variation in female candidates for Brazilian city council elections. Using cross-sectional data for two election years, the impact of cultural, socio-economic and political variables is measured, followed by a calculation of the optimal values of the variable under study&#13;
according to three interests: parties’ electoral results, male candidates’&#13;
electoral results and female candidates’ electoral results. We find that, though the first set of variables is significant, it explains only a small part, but average values of female candidates on parties’ lists are apparently converging to male’s optimum, suggesting that incumbents interests are dominating nominations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Primary health services exist with the purpose of providing basic health care to every person at a cost they can afford. But is it fully available to everyone? The objective of this work project is to estimate the demand for primary health care services having into account that in some regions the citizens are not using as much health care as they would like due to supply side constraints. Using the number of consultations as proxy for demand, and applying an econometric tool called switching regression, the demand for primary health care services will be estimated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The goal of this thesis is to make an internationalization plan of h3 to the German Market. h3 is a Portuguese fast-food restaurant chain mainly placed in the food courts of shopping centers serving a variety of menus with a mono-product, an hamburger. h3 has started the internationalization process in 2011 being now present in Spain, Poland and Brazil. The success of h3 in these countries encourages the company to keep up its expansion process. Its business can be replicated and transferable to Germany through franchising because h3 has a standardized process in the whole chain. Since the right partnership can define the company’s success, h3 can ask Franchise Pool International (FPI) to find a master partner. Even though h3 has to pay for having FPI’s services, it is expected that these costs will be compensated by the expected gains: the fees per opened store and the royalties per percentage of sales.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This project aims to propose innovative marketing strategies to deal with the decrease in foot traffic at Sonae Sierra shopping centers. This trend results from the emergence of a new consumer that is moving away from the hyper-consumerist society. Furthermore, the financial crisis is also contributing for this pattern. The proposed strategies aim to create connections with consumers and, ultimately, to create the necessary conditions to build&#13;
long-term relationships. The proposals are based on the main findings of the market&#13;
research and on the shopping centers value propositions, as well.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Casual Fast Food is a concept within the fast food market in which consumers, who eat on the run, demand for healthier options and superior outlets’ environment. Usually, ustomers order at the counter, the ingredients are fresh, and the meals are served in real plates (Franchise Help. 2011). h3 has successfully positioned in this segment benefiting from the growth Casual Fast Food has been experiencing in Portugal.&#13;
In 2011 the company began to internationalize firstly to Poland, then Spain and finally Brazil. h3 asked us the analysis of countries with high expenditure of fast food per capita such as: US, UK, Germany, France and Brazil. Those countries are potential markets to enter and/or expand in the future.&#13;
Throughout my work project I developed an internationalization plan of h3 into the UK&#13;
market. By internationalizing through a franchising model, h3 not only is able to enter in different markets at the same time, experiencing a fast expansion and increasing its brand recognition, but also it reduces the risk of failure in competitive markets.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work project consists of a sustainability report proposal for NovaSBE, consolidating its strategic goals of preparing students for sustainable development challenges of today’s organizations and communication towards stakeholders. This proposal arouses from the partnership with the Consultancy firm for Sustainable Development Sair da Casca. The first assignment given by the company consisted of building a sustainability observatorium that included the top 25 Portuguese companies’ sustainability practices. However, during the process, the company realized such a benchmarking tool already existed so that it did not make sense to develop it. It was then that from the alignment of interests between the company and the Field Lab purpose emerged the idea of a sustainability report for the school. To conduct a Sustainability Report Proposal for NovaSBE, the previous experience of collecting data on the top 25 companies’ sustainability practices allowed for a deeper knowledge on sustainability reporting.The Global Reporting Initiative sustainability reporting standards were chosen to carry this project out considering that its wider acceptance applies for NovaSBE’s internationalization ambitions. Nonetheless, the standard framework was adjusted to NovaSBE’s specificities in what sustainability is concerned. Overall, the results from this report’s proposal show that although NovaSBE has already taken several sustainability related measures they lack on strategic orientation and coordination, so that their full potential is not being achieved. Taking into consideration the conclusions, several recommendations for future sustainability reports are presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Medical Tourism is the new healthcare manager’s sweetheart. A package of fertility treatments, cosmetic surgery, bariatric surgery and many other medical procedures, wrapped with low prices, beautiful landscapes, sunny beaches and high quality healthcare is making Medical Tourism a billion euro industry.&#13;
This work project aims to endow the Health Authority of Algarve with a set of first steps to build the foundations of a Medical Tourism cluster which will harness the tourism, and medical potential of the region and use them as a driver for social and economic development.&#13;
The development of such a cluster will allow to enhance the strengths of each stakeholder and to position the region of Algarve and Portugal as a competitive international player in this new venture of Medical Tourism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work project discusses the key features that affect the Portuguese Football Market&#13;
and the business models presented by its football clubs by analyzing its unique&#13;
characteristics and performing a comparison with the main European championships.&#13;
The business models of Sport Clube Beira-Mar - Futebol, SAD, Sport Lisboa e Benfica&#13;
- Futebol, SAD, Sporting Clube de Braga - Futebol, SAD and three Portuguese Football&#13;
Academies were analyzed in order to understand the differences between clubs with&#13;
dissimilar goals and scopes and which aspects should be improved and explored.&#13;
Portuguese clubs present a significant competitive advantage in developing players as well as an important members base. However, they face many challenges due to low&#13;
stadium occupation rates, excessive dependence on certain revenue streams, lack of sports facilities utilization, a limited range of services, and the need to reformulate their revenue structure and increase the interaction with their fans and members by providing them enjoyable experiences beyond the football matches.&#13;
Hence, a set of recommendations and suggestions was developed, which was discussed with and approved by the previously mentioned clubs, in order to face the referred issues according to nine different operating areas of football clubs management and Portuguese Football in general: Restructuring of Portuguese football, Partnerships &amp; sponsorships/new services, New customer segments and retaining the current ones, Customer relationship management, Interaction with fans and members, Facilities&#13;
utilization/stadium occupation rates, Financial aspects, Participation in society/social concerns, and Internationalization/search for new revenues in emerging markets.</dc:description>

<dc:title>PME.Box: Internationalization to Poland</dc:title>

<dc:description>The present Business Plan analyzes the Polish market and determines how PME.BOX wants to expand its business to this market, in order to internationalize the firm and increase its business network, expand sales, diversify sources of sales and take advantage of market opportunities, hoping its business to grow and generate higher profit.&#13;
The intention of PME.BOX is not to become a very big and focused company in one place, instead, the company’s way of doing business is using partnerships and having joint ventures with other companies in different countries. For this reason, the right partnerships are crucial for the company to succeed in a new market.PME.BOX is a holding company composed by 4 shareholders and has one main product called pme.box, a cloud based business solution specially designed for micro, small and medium sized companies. It is a low cost solution with all the features needed for companies to manage their business in an efficient manner with quick access to business information. With pme.box, companies can manage their entire business from accounting to creating a website.&#13;
Poland arises today as one of the Central and Eastern Europe countries with a higher economical development and, as well as in all modern countries, is crucially created by national small and medium sized enterprises, which have a significant share in the process of economic growth creation in the country.&#13;
With the number of registered SMEs in Poland growing every year, PMEBOX intends to achieve 1% of the SMEs market, reaching revenues of 28.7M €, within the next 5 years.With the lack of integrated business solutions at competitive prices in the market, the Polish market arises now as a valuable strategic move for PME.BOX to expand its business to the Central and Eastern Europe.</dc:description>

<dc:description>For centuries, annual budgets have played a central key role in most organizations serving the main purposes of planning and control. Yet, more recently the budgeting practice has been subject to severe criticisms, among which stands its ineffectiveness to deal with uncertainty. In order to avoid some of the major problems associated with the preparation and usage of budgets, two alternative approaches have been proposed: Better Budgeting and Beyond Budgeting.&#13;
This study aims to understand which factors companies perceive as uncertainty, and how budgets, either in their traditional form or through new approaches, might be able to help companies deal with them. To do so, two companies with different dimensions, operating in different business sectors and thus subject to different economic contexts were analyzed.&#13;
Evidence collected seems to indicate that companies are indeed taking a new approach to budgeting, either simplifying it or complementing it with other techniques. The Balanced Scorecard, due to its capacity to link the short with the long-term strategy as well as to link different perspectives of the companies, comes up as one of the most useful techniques to complement budgets to face uncertainty.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Since November 2008, the Federal Reserve of the United States pursued a series of large-scale asset purchases, known as Quantitative Easing. In this Work Project, I describe the context, the objectives and the implementation of the Quantitative Easing. Additionally, I discuss its expected effects. Finally, I present empirical evidence of the effects on interest rates, output and inflation. I conclude that the first round of purchases was effective on preventing deflation and depression while the second had a small impact on economy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this work project I propose an innovative service – Electricity Feedback with Smart Meters through TV – to be considered as an additional test in the residential electricity use feedback trials currently being conducted in EDP’s InovCity project. My proposal is based on relevant past and current research studies, both Portuguese and international, which explain and support the proposed operationalization and characteristics of this new service. Furthermore, a careful analysis about the segmentation framing, the best market entry strategy and the consequences of adopting a joint venture with cable TV operators, is also provided. Finally, I present a SWOT analysis and highlight critical issues affecting the effectiveness of feedback which require further research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this work I propose an additional test to be implemented in EDP’s residential&#13;
electricity use feedback trials, under InovCity’s project scope. The proposed product to be tested consists of an interface between the smart meter and the television, through a&#13;
set-top box. I provide a theoretical framework of the importance of feedback, an&#13;
analysis of results from past studies involving smart metering, and a detailed description of my proposal. The results of a self-developed questionnaire related to the proposal and segmentation issues are also analyzed. Finally, general conclusions are drawn and&#13;
potential future improvements and challenges are presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this research is to study the Return on Equity of Portuguese and Brazilian companies, through the DuPont method. This project analyses whether differences in the ratios depend on specific features of the country, or if it is influenced by the industry where it is located. From the comparisons it is concluded that Brazilian companies pay higher corporate taxes and while the Portuguese companies are more leveraged, it is the Brazilian companies which pay higher interests. It is also noticeable that Portuguese companies take more advantage from the financing decisions and Brazilian on the investing decisions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In a world where it is even more important to be a global company to remain competitive, it is important that companies act not only regionally but also in foreign markets. In this report, I will develop an internationalization strategy for a small and medium enterprise, Abotoa, in order that one of its brand, SKYRO SHOES enters the USA market. Since the company already supplies the majority of the Portuguese airlines and has the desire to increase its sales volume and improve its brand awareness, following an internationalization process seems the right way to do this. It is important to note that I will highlight only one brand of the Abotoa, SKYPRO, because it is the one that, presently, has the highest potential for internationalization and that generates higher profits. At the end of this work project, I will provide reliable recommendations and solutions that could be adopted by Abotoa, in order to help this company to achieve its goals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Created in 2007, h3 is a Portuguese company that operates, mainly in Shopping Centres, in the fast food industry by offering cheap and unique “gourmet hamburgers” served on plates instead of bread.&#13;
In the beginning of 2011, the company started its international expansion programme by opening stores in Warsaw, Madrid and São Paulo, which were a great success; thus, the company wants to continue its internationalization to other markets.&#13;
As a result, this work project focused on the expansion of the h3 company to the US market, particularly to the New York State through a master franchising agreement. Although, this agreement will have some costs, these will be overcome by the advantages of having rapid expansion as well as an increase of brand awareness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>RESUMO - O presente trabalho pretende estudar a cultura de segurança de doente em alunos do ensino superior, na área das tecnologias de diagnóstico e terapêutica. Esta problemática não tem sido abordada pela comunidade científica, pelo que o seu estudo é relevante. Os alunos que finalizam a licenciatura estão legalmente autorizados para intervir perante o doente, contudo, a sensibilidade que têm para as questões da segurança do doente deve ser analisada com o intuito de melhorar a sua preparação como futuros profissionais de saúde.&#13;
Neste estudo participaram 180 alunos estratificados consoante o curso e sexo de modo a obter uma amostra representativa da população alvo. Foi constituído um questionário com 31 itens numa escala dicotómica que avaliam a cultura de segurança do doente em 7 dimensões – liderança, trabalho de equipa, a prática baseada na evidência científica, a comunicação, a aprendizagem, a justiça, e a prática clínica centrada no doente. Pode igualmente compor-se uma medida global de cultura de segurança do doente através do somatório das 7 dimensões. Os resultados evidenciam a existência de uma correlação positiva moderada entre as dimensões – Trabalho em equipa (0,660); Liderança (0,610); Prática baseada na evidência científica (0,627); Ambiente justo (0,570); Comunicação (0,501) e o Total.</dc:description>
<dc:description>ABSTRACT - The present work intends to study the patient safety culture on students in higher education, in the area of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. This problem has not been addressed by the scientific community, so its study is relevant due to the role that the TDT have before the patient. Students who finish a degree are legally entitled to act before the patient, however, the sensitivity that they have for patient safety issues must be considered in order to improve their preparation as future health care professionals.&#13;
This study involved 180 students laminated depending on the course and sex in order to get a representative sample of the target population. A questionnaire was set up with 31 items in a dichotomous scale that assesses the patient safety culture in 7 dimensions – leadership, teamwork, evidence-based, communication, learning, just, and the patient centered. It can also be composed a global measure of patient safety culture through the sum of the seven dimensions. The results demonstrate the existence of a moderate positive correlation between the dimensions – Teamwork (0.660); Leadership (0.610); Evidence-based (0.627); Just (0.570); Communication (0.501) and the Total.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper studies the effect of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on image and reputation in the case of L’Oréal and its acquisition of The Body Shop.&#13;
L’Oréal was suffering from negative headlines claiming that its products were animal tested and they expected that the acquisition of The Body Shop in 2006 would change this image.&#13;
This study investigates whether CSR practices of The Body Shop helped L’Oréal to rebound from the negative headings. Using a sample of 321 respondents for The Body Shop and a sample of 289 respondents for L’Oréal, it is concluded that CSR is an important factor for a company’s success since the results show that CSR campaigns have a statistically significant impact on a company’s reputation and image. Since a CSR strategy is the key to success, this paper ends with recommendations to successfully implement CSR strategies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Management from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>This study aims to understand children‟s perceptions of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives and its effect on the brand, namely Reputation and Identification. Moreover, it analyzes if the use of Cartoons helps to increase these effects. Differences among gender, age and social class, will also be considered.&#13;
292 children from the 3rd and 6th grades from 5 schools with different social backgrounds participated in this study. The research made use of a real brand targeting children. Drawings and questionnaires were used as the main research tools. Results suggest that CSR actions have a positive effect on Reputation and Identification and that Cartoons do not lead to greater positive effects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this report is to describe the main characteristics of structured products. These products can be divided in Capital Guaranteed products and Non Capital guaranteed products, having these two types of products different risk profiles and potential returns. In the final part of the report a Reverse Convertible on the S&amp;P500 is created, which offers 8.57% return per year subject to a capital loss in case the underlying goes below 70% initial level, in one year.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Science4You: Expanding the internationalization plan in Spain</dc:title>

<dc:description>After becoming a competitive player in the Portuguese toy market, Science4you aimed at internationalization as a viable option to increase its sales and establish itself as a reliable brand within the niche of scientific educational toys abroad. Despite being established only in 2008, the company has since acquired significant practical knowledge on negotiating with its partners to establish profitable and rewarding relationships. Within the internationalization strategy, focus was and is held upon European countries – with similar markets to the Portuguese – and upon Portuguese-speaking countries, with the intent on facilitating the process of entering the markets. Considering this context, it was not surprising that Science4you would start to sell to the Spanish market by the end of 2009 through an agreement with Fnac. While such partnership allowed for a quick and easy integration, such speedy process also had its drawbacks – as the company started selling to Spain that early, a research on the Spanish market and interpretation of its real opportunities, capacities and trends was never fully developed. As such, despite satisfactory results having been achieved thus far, I feel that this market holds many characteristics that differentiate itself from its Portuguese and other European counterparts, justifying a more thoughtful approach than that already in practice. Through it, Science4you can aim at achieving higher revenues by increases in sales, and to improve awareness in the local and European market. In this Work Project I will analyse what makes this company competitive, and a research of the industry for this target market will be provided. Then, and keeping in mind the company’s strategic objectives, I provide a set of recommendations that I find suited to improve not only its operations in the Spanish market, but to prepare the company for further expansion of its international presence. Maintaining the same mode of entry it employed when it first entered the market – exportation – some structural&#13;
changes are suggested as well as developments in terms of its operations, partnerships and presence in the Spanish market, aiming to adapt properly to its specific demands.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work studies the determinants of the sovereign CDS-bond basis distortions, in the Euro area, during the last crises period.&#13;
Regression analysis showed four relevant conclusions. Credit rating and credit outlook downgrades have a huge impact on the sovereign credit instruments premiums, although not originating arbitrage opportunities. Moreover, the ECB rate has a smoother effect on the sovereign debt markets’ functioning and the risk-transfer balance between the state and the financial sector seems to have shifted from one crisis period to the other. Finally, markets’ liquidity is the most powerful force in driving arbitrage opportunities in the sovereign debt market.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present article is based on the report for the Doctoral Conference of the PhD programme in Technology Assessment, held at FCT-UNL Campus, Monte de Caparica, July 9th, 2012. The PhD thesis has the supervision of Prof. Cristina Sousa (ISCTE-IUL), and co-supervision of Prof. José Cardoso e Cunha (FCT-UNL).</dc:description>
<dc:description>In this work we propose the use of Social Network Analysis to understand the positioning of the concept of Open Innovation in the literature, offering thereby a complementary approach to existing literature review up to now. The main motivation of this network analysis is to contribute to the understanding of the concept of Open Innovation, with its spread to different areas of knowledge over the years and its relationship with other concepts in the literature. Some 403 articles published in the database of the Science Direct during the years 2003 to 2011 were analyzed. The data was collected separately by year, considering the following information: journals in which the articles were published; countries of origin of the articles’ authors, keywords of these articles and year of publication. The results reveal the intense growth of the use of the words "Open Innovation" in articles from different areas of knowledge, as well as its increasing interconnection with other concepts, allowing the understanding of its diffusion in the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Este relatório de estágio divide‐se em duas partes fundamentais. A primeira consiste&#13;
numa descrição pormenorizada de todo o trabalho desenvolvido no âmbito das&#13;
atividades organizadas pelo Instituto de Defesa Nacional (IDN) – grupos de estudo,&#13;
cursos de formação, conferências – e respetivos resultados a nível de aprendizagem. A&#13;
segunda parte diz respeito ao trabalho de revisão bibliográfica (este, por sua vez,&#13;
independente das atividades do IDN) desenvolvido ao longo do estágio e cujos&#13;
resultados foram publicados no IDN Brief, uma das publicações do Instituto de Defesa&#13;
Nacional. Este trabalho de pesquisa e reflexão incidiu sobre o tema da Guerra Justa e&#13;
Intervenções Humanitárias, sobre o qual se reacendeu um debate intenso aquando da&#13;
intervenção militar na Líbia, em março de 2011</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Portuguese educational system has counted, for many years, with the co-existence of both public and private schools. In fact, the country’s growth and development led, in the past, to an increasing demand for free of charge public education that could only be matched through the creation of “publicly-subsidized and privately owned and managed schools”. Still, the demographic evolution of Portugal recently generated a decrease on the demand for public educational services. This situation has raised doubts about the true contribution of this type of school for the public education system. This paper aims at answering this question by isolating the impact of different property and management schemes on the performance of students, resorting to cross-section data on 9th grade students from 2010. The results corroborate the well known result on the relevance of the family socio-economic background for students’ performance, but do also sustain the existence of a significant positive impact of private ownership and management schemes on the overall performance of students. These results suggest that there might be gains associated with the expansion of such schemes within the public education system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This Work Project is integrated on SME Competitiveness: internationalization strategy field lab and its aim is to study a Portuguese SME. Abotoa is a small and medium enterprise that sells corporative footwear to a specific niche market – airline industry.&#13;
The main goal of internationalization of this company is to increase both sales and profitability, which is Skypro’s major short/medium-term goal. Since the Portuguese market has already saturated, Skypro sells to almost all Portuguese airline companies and Skypro has already tried to reach new markets by internationalization.&#13;
The Middle East appears to Skypro as one of the best regions to expand its sales. It is a region where the majority of the airline companies provide footwear to its employees and where some big companies employ, at least, the same number of the current biggest client of Skypro, TAP. These companies have a great commitment to quality service and the image wear is very important. They are also concerned about providing good footwear to its employees. The airline industry has been having high growth rates. Therefore, we can conclude that it is a very good region to invest/penetrate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this Work Project, in partnership with WACT, is to propose a pilot program based on solid research to extend WACT’s activities in Bairro Padre Cruz, a neighborhood in disadvantaged socio-economic circumstances. Catapultas focuses on children and their education, given its large benefits for current and future generations. Researchers agree that family background is a main driver of educational inequality and its persistence. Catapultas is a mentoring pilot program for 20 children in the 5th grade, it aims to introduce an external element, the mentor, in their lives, leading to improvements in educational and social development.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The determinants of SMEs capital structure: Overcoming supply constraints</dc:title>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Management from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>This paper studies the most relevant literature on firms’ capital structure, in general, and Small and Medium Enterprises, in particular. Evidencing that SMEs’ financing needs to evolve with their age, literature notes that failures in this market stem generally from a shortage in capital supply and from the extreme degree of opacity which characterizes young and small corporations. The forthcoming Basel III regulations will strengthen the future banking environment but probably affect even more financing to small businesses. Given that the imperfections of this market are not only present in periods of economic turmoils but also on a structural basis, finding ways to enhance SMEs’ transparency, and designing instrument to reduce dependence from bank credit, should be a priority for future actions undertaken by practitioners and regulators. Following the effective examples of the Indian SMEs Rating Agency, of the Korean corporate bonds market and of the growing phenomenon of crowdfunding, this work analyzes their pros and cons as well as their potential to become worldwide industry standards.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The determinants of variation in firm leverage across European countries</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Taddei, Alessandro</dc:creator>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Management from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>In this paper I empirically test what variables directly affect firm leverage across European countries, considering institutional, economic and macroeconomic variables. I find evidence in favour of the trade-off theory, given by the positive relation between profitability and leverage, and also evidence in favour of the pecking-order theory, given by the negative relation between tax rate and leverage. Thus, at the country-level, capital structure choices are partially explained by the trade-off theory and the pecking-order theory. In addition, I find that institutional and macroeconomic factors, such as entry into the EMU and economic crisis, greatly impact firm leverage across European Countries.</dc:description>

<dc:description>After four years in the market, GuestCentric (GC) Systems, a hospitality software Portuguese company, has not yet been able to reach break even. So the question that arises is why? To answer that question ones needs to analyze the market the company operates, the main competitors and the company itself. That is what I have done in this work project, and after that I developed a marketing plan to help the company to improve its results, thus helping the business to growth.&#13;
I started by analyzing the external environment of the company, then I studied GC’s internal situation, especially their competitive advantages. After identifying some of the main problems GC is facing, I decided to conduct a marketing plan to solve some of the problems and to give suggestions of improvement. An analysis of the strategic triangle and marketing mix was developed and some conclusions were reached. Finally I conclude the paper by providing some recommendations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper studies the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on Portuguese banks’ share prices. I employ an event study methodology to assess the behavior of banks’ share prices before, and after a credit rating announcement in relation to both the sovereign and the banks individually. I find that sovereign credit ratings have a significant impact on banks’ stock market returns while individual bank credit ratings seem to have little influence. This is probably due to the fact that banks’ credit ratings have been reflecting changes in sovereign ratings rather than any idiosyncratic factors of banks’ solvency. Among the rating agencies studied the most predominant is Standard &amp; Poor’s. Furthermore, I find that the behavior of banks’ stock returns exhibit a certain degree of market inefficiency and anticipation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work project analyzes the impact of being dismissed, in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, for highly-qualified individuals, as well as the strategies they used and the key competences in the job search. Considering the individual impact, it was possible to aggregate the sample in three groups: those who were hurt, those who saw an opportunity and those who kept a “healthy level of concern”. Their personality traits and competences deeply influenced the unemployment period and the strategies used. Being network the most successful one, people who chose a systematic and organized approach were emphasized.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research aims to study the impact that L’Oréal’s acquisition of The Body Shop had on consumers’ identification with both brands. Our research was based on the assumption that because both companies have different cultures and values, this could lead to changes in their brand identifications. Consumers from both brands were evaluated separately and both samples were further divided into two sub-samples: the ones that had previous knowledge about the acquisition and the ones who didn’t.&#13;
Through this research we concluded that consumers from both brands are environmentally-conscious and also that both considered that company’s social responsibility practices heavily weighed when deciding where to buy. This research was developed based on the Consumer-Company Identification model with some adaptations based on the recent literature. The results suggest that consumers have a strong relationship with both brands. Those who knew a priori about the acquisition expressed that it didn’t have much impact on their perception and purchase behavior. For those who only acknowledged it during the research also demonstrated a remaining strong brand identification (with both brands), although with results weaker than before.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The primary purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of mass retailers on Municipal Markets in the city of Lisboa between 2004 and 2009. A Prais-Winsten regression with specific panel AR(1) and PCSEs was used to estimate the model. The findings reveal that, on average, an increase of 1 supermarket per km2 within the “Freguesia” where the municipal market is located leads to a decrease of 3.48% in the occupation rates while an increase of 0.1 hypermarkets per km2 leads to a decrease of 5.62% if it is located within the “Freguesia” and of 10.10% if it is located in the adjacent ones.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Métodos de avaliação da frequência de eventos adversos em contexto hospitalar : contributos de uma revisão sistemática</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rodrigues, Vanessa</dc:creator>
<dc:contributor>Sousa, Paulo</dc:contributor>
<dc:description>RESUMO - Os eventos adversos (EA) hospitalares constituem um problema sério dos cuidados de saúde com consequências clínicas, económicas e sociais para a Saúde Pública.&#13;
Nas últimas décadas foram realizados diversos estudos com o objetivo de conhecer de forma mais pormenorizada esta realidade, nomeadamente no que diz respeito à frequência, tipologia, evitabilidade e impacte dos EA. De entre as diferentes metodologias que têm sido utilizadas parece existir algum consenso em torno da análise retrospetiva de processos clínicos como a que oferece maior garantia de fiabilidade e reprodutibilidade, não obstante as limitações conhecidas.&#13;
Assim, propusemo-nos com este trabalho, analisar as vantagens e desvantagens dos métodos mais comummente utilizados para caraterizar a ocorrência de EA e, concomitantemente elaborar uma revisão sistemática (RS) dos estudos que aplicaram o método de revisão retrospetiva de processos clínicos na caraterização e avaliação dos EA em contexto hospitalar.&#13;
Para definir a nossa amostra, realizámos uma pesquisa formal nas bases de dados MEDLINE e Web of Knowledge, e foi realizado um cruzamento manual de referências dos artigos elegíveis para identificar estudos adicionais relevantes. Os artigos selecionados foram revistos independentemente no que diz respeito à metodologia, aos critérios de elegibilidade e aos objetivos. Durante a fase de revisão e aplicação dos critérios de inclusão e exclusão foram selecionados os artigos que abordassem a frequência/incidência e a percentagem de evitabilidade dos EA hospitalares, através da aplicação do método de revisão retrospetiva de processos clínicos.&#13;
Após a fase de pesquisa e revisão dos artigos, foram selecionados para a nossa amostra oito estudos que incluíram um total de 28.862 processos clínicos revistos. De entre os principais resultados encontrados destaca-se:&#13;
i) A mediana de incidência de EA hospitalares de 9.5%; Universidade Nova de Lisboa – Escola Nacional de Saúde Pública&#13;
ii) O valor de mediana de EA considerados evitáveis de 45.5%;&#13;
iii) No que se refere ao impacte clínico dos EA, mais de metade dos doentes (56.3%) não experienciou incapacidade ou experienciou incapacidade menor;&#13;
iv) Em 8% dos casos de EA ocorreu a morte dos doentes.&#13;
v) Quanto ao impacte económico evidencia-se o facto de, nos doentes em que se confirmou EA, o período de internamento se ter prolongado, em média, por 7.1 dias com consequentes e previsíveis custos adicionais.&#13;
Tendo em consideração as vantagens e desvantagens de cada método, os sistemas de informação existentes em Portugal e a realidade das instituições de saúde, parece-nos plausível destacar o método de revisão dos processos clínicos como o que melhor se adapta para caraterizar os EA no contexto hospitalar português.</dc:description>
<dc:description>ABSTRACT - Adverse events (AE) in hospitals constitute a serious problem with severe clinical, economic and social consequences to Public Health.&#13;
In the last decades, several studies have been conducted in order to gain an insight into this reality, particularly with regard to the frequency, type, preventability and impact of AE.&#13;
Among the different methodologies that have been used to evaluate this problem, there seems to be some consensus about the assurance of reliability and reproducibility of retrospective record review method.&#13;
Our primary endpoints are analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the methods most commonly used to characterize the occurrence of AE, and concomitantly develop a systematic review (SR) of the studies that have applied the method of retrospective clinical record review in characterization and evaluation of AE in hospital setting.&#13;
Our formal search was performed in MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge databases and was completed with a manual cross-references to achieve additional and relevant studies for our sample.&#13;
The studies were reviewed independently for methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria and endpoints. During the review and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected articles that addressed the frequency/incidence and the preventability of AE in hospitals, by applying the method of retrospective record review.&#13;
We selected eight studies for our sample, involving a total of 28.862 medical records reviewed. Among the main findings we can stand out:&#13;
i) The median incidence of AE in hospitals was 9.5%;&#13;
ii) The median percentage of preventability was 45.5%;&#13;
iii) More than half of patients (56.3%) didn’t experienced or experienced minor disability, whereas 8% of events were lethal;&#13;
iv) The median additional days in hospital due to AE was 7.1 days per patient.&#13;
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each method analyzed, the existing information systems in Portugal and the reality of health institutions, it seems plausible to highlight the method of retrospective record review as the most suited to characterize AE in Portuguese hospitals’.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ethically correct business decisions and the respect for applicable laws and regulations&#13;
have become in demand for regulators and supervisors, but especially for the general&#13;
public. For those behaviors to happen, compliance culture is an essential requirement.&#13;
Through survey research, we prove the existence of a relationship between the workers’ level of compliance culture and their hierarchical position, which may indicate communication problems between hierarchies. This area is also given a comprehensive outlook, as the globalization process combined with financial regulatory reforms lead multinational corporations to a more challenging equilibrium between their compliance departments’ actions and budgets.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this assignment I build an intuitive panel regression model, in order to achieve a clear isolation of the impact of the inception of the first Exchange Traded Fund created on the FTSE100 index on the price efficiency of its underlying stocks. The main finding of this analysis is that price efficiency at the individual stock market decreases after ETF introduction. Thus, the adverse selection hypothesis highlights the shift of liquidity traders to the basket security, leaving informed traders exposed in the individual market. This decrease is evident and significant for different time range samples employed, as well as for the several measures of price efficiency used.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work project provides evidence on the positive effect of trade liberalization&#13;
on productivity growth in the Brazilian automotive industry. I use data before&#13;
and after trade liberalization. The positive effect of trade liberalization found&#13;
here supports the idea that the adoption of higher tariffs on imports in this sector&#13;
is not justified. This idea is also supported by the fact that production increased since trade liberalization. Higher tariffs on imports of vehicles are one of the&#13;
measures of the recently announced plan Brasil Maior. According to the results&#13;
found here, the effect of this new protectionist measure might be the loss of&#13;
productivity and efficiency of the industry in the long run and the supply of&#13;
expensive products in the domestic market.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The importance of the Earnings per Share (EPS) has been increasing in the last decade and its disclosures have become more common. Still, there are no studies about EPS financial reporting in Portugal. Being so, this project offers a first analysis of EPS financial reporting in Portugal, reviewing the regulation, providing evidence on the current practices and presenting recommendations to improve them. It concludes that not all of the Portuguese companies are in compliance with regulation (IAS 33) regarding EPS; they only voluntarily disclose what is more favorable and the crisis of 2010 had a great impact on EPS amounts.</dc:description>

<dc:description>RESUMO - O estabelecimento de prioridades determina a sustentabilidade de qualquer sistema de&#13;
saúde, pelo que urge identificar os procedimentos, metodologias e critérios de priorização.&#13;
Não existem critérios nem métodos universais de os combinar, sendo que a sua seleção&#13;
depende do contexto de aplicação. O presente projeto de estudo exploratório-descritivo tem&#13;
por finalidade a criação de uma proposta de metodologia a adotar na determinação de&#13;
prioridades do Plano Regional de Saúde de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo 2011-2016,&#13;
contextualizada à região, tempo e circunstâncias. O estudo está organizado em duas etapas&#13;
metodológicas: uma revisão bibliográfica, dirigida à identificação do método e dos critérios&#13;
de determinação de prioridades, e a realização de um painel de Delphi, para validação do&#13;
método de determinação de prioridades proposto, definição dos critérios e suas&#13;
ponderações. Tendo sido encontrada evidência na literatura sobre as vantagens da&#13;
utilização da Análise Multicritério da Tomada de Decisão, através da utilização do Método&#13;
Aditivo Linear, na determinação de prioridades em saúde, foi selecionada esta metodologia,&#13;
que obteve a concordância de 85% dos participantes para a sua utilização no contexto em&#13;
estudo, na primeira ronda do painel de Delphi. Os resultados preliminares do estudo, obtidos&#13;
na primeira ronda, mostram que um dos onze critérios propostos foi excluído, tendo sido&#13;
sugeridos sete novos critérios pelos participantes, que serão sujeitos a análise nas rondas&#13;
subsequentes. Os resultados obtidos poderão servir de base a estudos mais aprofundados&#13;
nesta área e contribuir para o debate sobre os critérios subjacentes ao processo de&#13;
determinação de prioridades em saúde.</dc:description>
<dc:description>ABSTRACT - Priority setting determines the sustainability of all health systems, stressing the need of&#13;
identifying procedures, methodologies and prioritization criteria. There are no criteria neither&#13;
universal combination methods for establishing priorities, as their selection is dependent of&#13;
the context they are developed for. This exploratory-descriptive study aims to propose a&#13;
methodology to approach priority setting in the Regional Health Plan of Lisbon and Tagus&#13;
Valley 2011-2016, taking into account the regional timeframe and circumstances. The study&#13;
is organized in two distinct methodological phases: a literature review to identify methods&#13;
and criteria for determining priorities and a Delphi panel to validate the proposed method of&#13;
determining priorities, their definition and weight. The literature showed positive evidence for&#13;
the use of Multicriteria Decision Analysis, using the Linear Additive Method, in determining&#13;
health priorities. This methodology was selected and obtained a concordance of 85%&#13;
amongst the participants for its use in the context of the health plan, in the first round of the&#13;
panel. The preliminary results of the study at the first round of the panel show that one of the&#13;
eleven proposed criteria was excluded, and seven new were suggested by the participants,&#13;
and will be subjected to new subsequent rounds. The results can be the basis for more&#13;
profound studies addressing this issue and contribute to the debate on the underlying criteria&#13;
in the process of setting health priorities.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A infertilidade na mulher e a ocorrência de infecções sexualmente transmissíveis em idade fértil</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Palma, Cátia Alexandra Pereira Teixeira</dc:creator>
<dc:contributor>Paixão, Maria Teresa</dc:contributor>
<dc:description>RESUMO - Enquadramento: Num momento em que a população mundial atinge os 7 biliões, um dos capítulos do&#13;
Relatório do Fundo de População das Nações Unidas é dedicado à fertilidade. A maioria dos países&#13;
europeus apresenta taxas de fecundidade abaixo das necessárias para a reposição populacional. Portugal&#13;
não é excepção, apresentando um índice sintético de fecundidade, em 2009 de 1,32 crianças por mulher.&#13;
Calcula-se que 10% dos casais portugueses são inférteis, com uma distribuição equitativa de causas&#13;
femininas e masculinas (30% individualmente e 90% em conjunto). Para esta diminuição da taxa de&#13;
fecundidade concorrem vários determinantes, entre eles a ocorrência de infecções sexualmente&#13;
transmissíveis anteriores que desencadeiam alterações do aparelho genital feminino, provocando doença&#13;
pélvica inflamatória e consequentemente infertilidade. Das infecções sexualmente transmissíveis, a&#13;
infecção por Chlamydia trachomatis continua a ser a mais reportada por toda a Europa, encontrada em&#13;
rastreios em grupos de jovens com idades abaixo dos 25 anos. É uma infecção passível de ser tratada, com&#13;
cura, embora não confira uma imunidade duradoura. As infecções sexualmente transmissíveis, algumas&#13;
delas há muito conhecidas do homem, constituem uma causa evitável de infertilidade.&#13;
Finalidade / Objectivos:&#13;
Conhecer a frequência de infecções sexualmente transmissíveis na história ginecológica de mulheres com&#13;
infertilidade, com a finalidade de poder contribuir para o desenvolvimento de novas estratégias na Saúde&#13;
Reprodutiva para aumentar a índice sintético de fecundidade de Portugal.&#13;
Metodologia: Estudo exploratório, natureza retrospectiva, uma vez que partimos do problema infertilidade,&#13;
e averiguam-se antecedentes de infecções sexualmente transmissíveis, através da aplicação de um&#13;
questionário às mulheres seguidas em consulta de infertilidade em instituições de saúde do SNS na área de&#13;
abrangência da ARS LVT, durante o período de 1 de Janeiro a 31 de Dezembro de 2012.&#13;
Discussão / Conclusão: É expectável que os resultados obtidos neste estudo vão de encontro ao que é&#13;
relatado na literatura, confirmando a hipótese de trabalho que aponta para a existência de infecções&#13;
sexualmente transmissíveis em mulheres seguidas em consultas de infertilidade. Certo é que a infertilidade&#13;
tende a ser uma realidade crescente, associada a múltiplos factores, sendo que um deles continua a ser a&#13;
exposição a agentes microbianos, constituindo em si mesma uma causa evitável. Se pretendemos&#13;
aumentar o índice sintético de fecundidade de Portugal, é necessário investir também no estudo dos&#13;
determinantes que concorrem para a fertilidade. Na realidade, para além da emergente necessidade de&#13;
implementar um sistema de vigilância nacional das infecções sexualmente transmissíveis, é necessária uma&#13;
aposta mais profunda na informação / educação, sensibilização dos jovens ainda antes do início da&#13;
actividade sexual, e não apenas nas consultas de planeamento familiar. É certamente um trabalho&#13;
pluridisciplinar que envolve parceiros comunitários como a escola e outros centros educativos, a família, o&#13;
centro de saúde, a sociedade em geral, em particular, cada um de nós.</dc:description>

<dc:description>RESUMO - O processo de comunicação em saúde encontra-se relacionado com a melhoria dos resultados em saúde através da informação, com o objectivo de influenciar indivíduos e comunidades. Os profissionais de saúde, no contexto da prestação de cuidados, necessitam de deter determinadas competências interpessoais e de comunicação no sentido de promover a qualidade e segurança do doente, contribuindo para a diminuição do erro clínico através de uma comunicação eficaz em equipa. Estabelecer uma relação de empatia e confiança com o doente, saber escutar e compreender a sua perspectiva definem-se, entre outras, por capacidades essenciais a estes profissionais, a par de uma comunicação verbal e escrita clara e assertiva, cujo impacto se reflecte também na satisfação do utente. O ensino destas competências é fundamental para habilitar os profissionais a lidar com diversas situações, contribuindo para a excelência técnica e qualidade dos cuidados. A sua avaliação é essencialmente realizada durante a formação académica, a nível internacional, sobre o que a literatura descreve várias metodologias possíveis. O método utilizado com maior frequência consiste na observação directa da interacção entre o aluno e o doente, em contexto real ou simulado, através de uma checklist formada por itens correspondentes a atitudes e comportamentos que avalia a presença das competências necessárias. O desenvolvimento destas competências passa por sensibilizar os profissionais para a sua importância, dar-lhes formação e avaliar, apostando na continuidade da investigação.</dc:description>
<dc:description>ABSTRACT - The process of health communication is related to the improvement of health outcomes through information, by influencing individuals and communities. Healthcare providers need to detain interpersonal and communication skills to promote quality and patient safety, and contributing to the decrease of clinical error through effective communication in the team. Establish a relationship of trust and empathy with the patient, learn to listen and understand his perspective are, amongst others, essential skills to these professionals, alongside a verbal, and clear and assertive writing communication, which has impact in patient satisfaction. The teaching of these skills is crucial to enable professionals to deal with various situations, contributing to technical excellence and quality of care. Its assessment is primarily held during the academic training, in other countries, on what literature describes several possible methodologies. The most frequently used method consists in the direct observation of the encounter between the student and the patient, in a real or simulated context, through a checklist formed by matching items the attitudes and behaviors that evaluates the presence of skills required. These skills can be developed by sensitize professionals to its importance, by teaching and evaluation, and continuing to research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this work project is to suggest a communication plan to solve an identified problem of Continente, the food retail leader in the Portuguese market. To identify the current communication problems of the brand, a quantitative questionnaire was conducted together with two models – Creative Business Ideas Development and 4 Though Starters. Several problems were found but the one selected was the fact that consumption in Continente stores is mainly made on a monthly basis. I propose a communication plan to promote fresh products of Continente own brands as a solution to this problem.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The importance of this research is related with the value of the value relevance literature and its contribution to accounting setters. It is indeed emphasized by the changes in IAS 19 proposed by the IASB in 2010. In this context, the primary objective of this study is to provide a literature review regarding post-retirement benefits with focus in defined benefit plans, taking into consideration the way to account for that and its relation with equity value and also the value relevance from an investor perspective within benefit plans accounting. As conclusion, we identified in previous literature that the full recognition of actuarial gains and losses in equity is more value relevant to the investor, wich is according the last amendment of IAS 19, and its main proposition is the elimination of the corridor approach.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Despite the extensive literature on the predictability of asset class returns and its&#13;
economic significance, it is common for many asset managers to implement portfolio&#13;
models built around active management within an asset class, while generally having&#13;
passive allocations to each asset class based on the risk profile of the investor. We can exploit some of the predictability by using information on economic factors and&#13;
momentum that explain broad asset class moves through a parametric portfolio&#13;
approach introduced by Brandt, Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2009). I obtain significant&#13;
improvements over fixed allocations and Markowitz optimal portfolios, even when&#13;
applying significant restrictions.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A relação entre eficiência e efectividade : aplicação ao internamento por doença cerebrovascular</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lopes, Silvia da Silva</dc:creator>
<dc:contributor>Costa, Carlos</dc:contributor>
<dc:description>RESUMO - Contexto: O estudo da relação entre eficiência e efectividade é relevante na investigação dos serviços de saúde, pois pretende-se conhecer os mecanismos que ligam os recursos investidos na prestação aos resultados em saúde experienciados pelos doentes e decorrentes desses mesmos cuidados. Os objectivos definidos para este trabalho consistiram, genericamente, no estudo da efectividade e da eficiência dos cuidados prestados em internamento a uma doença em particular – a doença cerebrovascular – e da relação entre ambas, tanto ao nível do episódio como do hospital. Pretendia-se ainda conhecer a consistência destes resultados, nomeadamente de que forma a relação entre efectividade e eficiência era influenciada pelas características dos hospitais.&#13;
Metodologia: Foram seguidas duas abordagens: (1) conhecer o impacte dos diferentes níveis de recursos investidos no tratamento (eficiência medida pelos custos) sobre os resultados ao nível da mortalidade; (2) estimar o montante de recursos (medidos pelos custos) associados ao tratamento das complicações potencialmente evitáveis. A análise foi realizada para os episódios de internamento de doença cerebrovascular com alta no período 2005/07. Usou-se a informação da base de dados dos resumos de alta, da contabilidade analítica e da Matriz de Maryland. O estudo considerou medidas de resultados – mortalidade, complicações e custos – e o desempenho foi avaliado a partir da comparação entre os valores observados e esperados. Para o ajustamento pelo risco recorreu-se ao Disease Staging recalibrado aos dados em estudo. Na primeira abordagem usou-se a regressão logística: a mortalidade medida pela efectividade constituiu a variável dependente; a eficiência medida pelos custos, os atributos do hospital e o ano as independentes. O modelo foi também testado em subconjuntos da população. Ao nível do hospital, foram definidos quartis de desempenho na efectividade medida pela mortalidade, analisando-se o comportamento da eficiência medida pelos custos em cada um deles. Estudou-se ainda a análise da correlação entre medidas e os hospitais nos extremos do desempenho. Na segunda abordagem, procedeu-se à comparação entre os custos dos doentes com complicações e sem complicações em doentes de gravidade semelhante. A análise foi realizada para o conjunto de todas as complicações, por tipo de complicação e por hospital.&#13;
Resultados: Os principais resultados encontrados quanto ao impacte dos diferentes níveis de recursos investidos no tratamento (eficiência medida pelos custos) sobre os resultados ao nível da mortalidade indicaram que, ao nível do episódio, não existia uma relação geral entre eficiência e efectividade, pois o uso de mais recursos traduzia-se quer em melhores quer em piores resultados na mortalidade, quer na ausência de efeito sobre os mesmos, com resultados consistentes ao longo dos anos em estudo. Ao nível do hospital, as conclusões foram consistentes com o encontrado ao nível do episódio – o comportamento dos prestadores na eficiência foi distinto e não acompanhou o que apresentaram na efectividade. Relativamente à estimativa dos custos adicionais decorrentes de complicações dos cuidados, o custo de tratamento dos doentes com complicações foi entre 2,2 a 2,8 vezes o valor dos doentes sem complicações. Estes resultados foram consistentes com a análise por tipo de complicação e por hospital. Foi ainda de assinalar a grande disparidade na frequência de complicações entre hospitais.&#13;
Conclusão: Os resultados encontrados mostram a importância de uma gestão criteriosa dos recursos actuais e adicionais dedicados à prestação de cuidados de saúde, uma vez que em algumas situações se verifica que o seu acréscimo não se traduz numa melhoria dos resultados em saúde estudados. Sugerem ainda um conjunto de matérias que deverão ser alvo de investigação futura, para conhecer em maior profundidade os mecanismos da relação entre eficiência e efectividade e identificar as circunstâncias em que é possível prosseguir na melhoria quer da eficiência quer da efectividade.</dc:description>
<dc:description>ABSTRACT - Background: The relation between efficiency and effectiveness is relevant in health services research since it is intended to study the links between the resources used for healthcare and its outcomes. This work aimed to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of care delivered to patients admitted with cerebrovascular disease and the relation between them, both at the hospital and patient level. It was also intended to know the impact hospital characteristics had in determining that relation.&#13;
Methods: Two approaches were followed – to know the impact the amount of resources used had in effectiveness (measured by mortality) and to estimate the additional cost incurred when complications of care exist. The population studied included inpatient episodes of cerebrovascular disease in the period 2005/07. Administrative data, accounting data and the Maryland matrix were used for that purpose. Since the study considered outcome measures – mortality, complications of care, costs – performance was evaluated comparing observed and expected values. Information from Disease Staging was recalibrated to the population selected for the study and used for risk adjustment. At the patient level, a logistic regression with effectiveness (mortality) as dependent variable was used. Independent variables were efficiency (cost), hospital characteristics and year of data. The same method was used to study patients treated in different groups of hospitals. At the patient level, correlation, quartiles and individual analysis of top / bottom performers were ran. For the second approach, costs of patients with / without complications were compared, for groups of similar severity. The same method was used for each of the most frequent types of complications and for each hospital, also for goups of similar severity.&#13;
Results: At the patient level, there was no relation between efficiency and effectiveness since the use of more resources implied better, worse or had no effect in mortality outcomes for all years considered. At the hospital level, results were consistent: hospitals performed differently in efficiency and effectiveness and there was no identifiable pattern. As for additional costs of complications of care, it was 2,2 to 2,8 times higher for patients with complications, compared with patients without them. These results were consistent for all complications and hospitals studied. The differences in the frequency of complications per hospital were relevant.&#13;
Conclusions: These results show the importance of a careful management of the funds used in healthcare, since in some cases the increase of costs didn’t mean that patients had better results in the outcomes studied. They also suggest some further studies, so that the links between efficiency and effectiveness can be known and the circumstances under which hospitals can improve both efficiency and effectiveness simultaneously are identified.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years scholars have been developing various theoretical models to measure the effects of corporate social responsibility activities on customer perceptions and on customer-company identification. While significant advances have been made in demonstrating the positive effects of CSR initiatives, little research has been focused on how a structured approach to CSR affects these variables. This study aims to demonstrate the major positive effects of a strategic approach to CSR in comparison to a philanthropic approach, and to provide managers with useful advices for the creation of shared value for the society.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The possibility to fulfill the lack of studies comparing methods for financial assets accounting at fair value in terms of value relevance for investors is the main contribution of this research. Such contribution is emphasized by the importance of assessing how well accounting amounts reflect information used by investors. This study compares available for sale financial assets with financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in terms of value relevance for investors. The results evidence that although accounting differently both methods provide equally strong explanatory power of security prices which favors fair value accounting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When I first took up this project the goal was to conceive a communication strategy for Continente. My first impression was that the biggest drawback of Continente was their localization and lack of convenience. After carrying out a market research I confirmed this theory and began strategizing against it. Although my initial brainstorm varies in target and objective, I’ve realized that all the solutions focused at some point, on the Continente’s convenience problem.&#13;
Finally, I have decided to focus on the “The single young shoppers” target (young people who have moved out of their parents’ house either by need of independence or to be nearer to university/work). I believe this segment to be extremely important, not just because of their present value but mostly to attract the youngest generations to the brand, and to create a bond and loyalty with them right now. My solution, “The Continente Choose&amp;Drive” where the consumer can shop without leaving the car through a drive-in system, intends to minimize the gap between the target and the brand, as well as boost their image of innovation and consumer-focused.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In a context of economic recession, where resource scarcity follows every manager, efficiency is the only way out. Health Care is no exception. Continuous budgetary cuts from central authorities led to increasing pressures in hospital managers to achieve efficient results. In light of being able to quantify efficiency, this work project has the aim of identifying the best of two frontier based analysis (Stochastic Frontier Analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis) by performing efficiency estimations for a single year using variables from the Portuguese reality, allowing the identification of inefficiency sources.&#13;
Efficiency scores will be obtained to compare hospitals for efficiency ranks and several efficiency-seeking suggestions will be stated in the end.&#13;
The scores obtained from the estimations show that some hospitals still have a rough path to endure if they are to achieve economic efficiency. From the analysis we can see that efficient hospitals vary for each model. (8 in SFA [hospitals with a score higher than 0.95] and 17 in DEA). Estimation outputs suggest that changes in hospital size or services provided should occur in order to achieve higher efficiency, which is in light with the presently taken health policies.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Economic analysis in health care regulation : three essays</dc:title>

<dc:description>ABSTRACT - It is the purpose of the present thesis to emphasize, through a series of examples, the need and&#13;
value of appropriate pre-analysis of the impact of health care regulation. Specifically, the thesis&#13;
presents three papers on the theme of regulation in different aspects of health care provision&#13;
and financing. The first two consist of economic analyses of the impact of health care regulation&#13;
and the third comprises the creation of an instrument for supporting economic analysis of&#13;
health care regulation, namely in the field of evaluation of health care programs.&#13;
The first paper develops a model of health plan competition and pricing in order to understand&#13;
the dynamics of health plan entry and exit in the presence of switching costs and alternative&#13;
health premium payment systems. We build an explicit model of death spirals, in which profitmaximizing&#13;
competing health plans find it optimal to adopt a pattern of increasing relative&#13;
prices culminating in health plan exit. We find the steady-state numerical solution for the price&#13;
sequence and the plan’s optimal length of life through simulation and do some comparative&#13;
statics. This allows us to show that using risk adjusted premiums and imposing price floors are&#13;
effective at reducing death spirals and switching costs, while having employees pay a fixed&#13;
share of the premium enhances death spirals and increases switching costs.&#13;
Price regulation of pharmaceuticals is one of the cost control measures adopted by the&#13;
Portuguese government, as in many European countries. When such regulation decreases the&#13;
products’ real price over time, it may create an incentive for product turnover.&#13;
Using panel data for the period of 1997 through 2003 on drug packages sold in Portuguese&#13;
pharmacies, the second paper addresses the question of whether price control policies create&#13;
an incentive for product withdrawal. Our work builds the product survival literature by&#13;
accounting for unobservable product characteristics and heterogeneity among consumers when&#13;
constructing quality, price control and competition indexes. These indexes are then used as&#13;
covariates in a Cox proportional hazard model. We find that, indeed, price control measures&#13;
increase the probability of exit, and that such effect is not verified in OTC market where no such&#13;
price regulation measures exist. We also find quality to have a significant positive impact on&#13;
product survival.&#13;
In the third paper, we develop a microsimulation discrete events model (MSDEM) for costeffectiveness&#13;
analysis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus treatment, simulating individual paths&#13;
from antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation to death. Four driving forces determine the course&#13;
of events: CD4+ cell count, viral load resistance and adherence. A novel feature of the model with respect to the previous MSDEMs is that distributions of time to event depend on&#13;
individuals’ characteristics and past history. Time to event was modeled using parametric&#13;
survival analysis. Events modeled include: viral suppression, regimen switch due virological&#13;
failure, regimen switch due to other reasons, resistance development, hospitalization, AIDS&#13;
events, and death. Disease progression is structured according to therapy lines and the model is&#13;
parameterized with cohort Portuguese observational data.&#13;
An application of the model is presented comparing the cost-effectiveness ART initiation with&#13;
two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) plus one non-nucleoside&#13;
reverse transcriptase inhibitor(NNRTI) to two NRTI plus boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) in HIV-&#13;
1 infected individuals. We find 2NRTI+NNRTI to be a dominant strategy. Results predicted by&#13;
the model reproduce those of the data used for parameterization and are in line with those&#13;
published in the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Analysis of benefits of the process of certification on international standars: ISO 9001-2008 for Mapfre Assistencia Portugal</dc:title>

<dc:description>This report provides a preliminary analysis and evaluation of the current situation of&#13;
Mapfre Assistance Portugal in terms of productivity, performance, processes and need&#13;
of implementing the ISO 9001:2008 standards for the assistance service (call-center).&#13;
The decision about focusing on this part of the group of activities that compound the&#13;
whole services and products is mainly addressed to the fact that this process is vital when talking about reducing or avoiding unnecessary costs. Thus, the study focuses on the performance in terms of services rendered, files opened, turnover along the years and complaints, as well as the analysis of the flow of process (call center) along with some statistics about ISO 9000, ISO 9001 and related data from competitors. The results showed that the processes are going accordingly with the expectations of the company as the number of complaints is low compared with the turnover, the services required have no high variations and productivity levels are significantly positive. This happens&#13;
even when there are not documented records of the procedures that could contribute&#13;
with the effective allocation of work and activities.The report concludes that the possibility of Mapfre Assistance Portugal entering in a ISO 9001:2008 certification process is low, since the costs of certification are higher than the benefits that might arise, given the present strategic objectives that Mapfre Asistencia in Portugal is following, the economic situation of the country and the perception of ISO certifications in the sector and the country itself. The strategies of the&#13;
company would require the use of different tools and the planning of different strategies towards the accomplishment of the general targets of the group (Mapfre Asistencia). Thus, the recommendations are addressed more towards to policies that increase and improve the net of providers which can meet requirements and expectations from customers about solving issues related to greater speed and reliability. Therefore,&#13;
relation management strategies will be more appropriate since allow the company to get&#13;
to know the needs of different actors, namely: customers, suppliers, employees and&#13;
managers; and finally keep focused on internal control in order to improve the&#13;
dimensions rated as low by customers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research investigates the impact of perceived motives of CSR on consumer behavior. Specifically, it tests the strength that profit-seeking and altruistic motives have on influencing corporate image, consumer trust, perceived quality, perceived risk and purchase intention. The total of 183 consumers from one highly respected organization answered the survey. Results indicate that altruistic motives seem to positively influence all variables of consumer behaviors contained in this study and seems to be a way of strengthening the relationship between consumers and the company itself.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Miller and Modigliani (1961) curiosity awoke the interest of professionals to look&#13;
into share repurchases. The aim of this study is to analyse how relevant were the&#13;
treasury stocks in the Portuguese listed companies accounts for 2010. From the sample&#13;
analysis of the PSI Geral (Portuguese Stock Exchange companies), most of the companies had in their account treasury stocks and half of them traded them during the year. The research contributes to present the reality of the Portuguese listed companies&#13;
in terms of regulation, disclosures, and financial statement analysis numbers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Finance from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>This project provides evidence about the practices of financial reporting regarding provisions namely presentation, recognition, measurement and disclosure in the consolidated annual reports in 2010 and 2009 of Portuguese non-financial companies listed in the Euronext Lisbon.&#13;
Moreover it updates the findings of previous literature, analyzes the compliance with IAS 37 and identifies its main issues. The findings suggest that there exists room for improvement of provisions reporting in Portugal, as requirements are in some cases not followed in full and there is unclear information, so the research recommends to regulators, preparers and users in order to address those issues.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the disclosure of the conclusions of the Republic of Ireland’s Smart Metering Trials, this report intends to summarize the experience and the Consumer Behavior results. I also complement the Irish report by examining the effect of demographic and attitudinal variables in the change of electricity consumption during the trial and by studying the accuracy of the participants’ perception of the change in their consumptions and bills during the experience. The main conclusion is that the participants were not able to take full advantage of the potentiality of the Time-of-Use tariffs to reduce bills and did not have a clear perception of their consumptions and spending, which may have prevented them of achieving better results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aiming at filling a gap in the literature, which has been concentrated on USA and Western-European Countries, this paper analyzes the Polish corporate network based on interlocking directorates among 125 top companies in the country. To determine the characteristics of the network and its implications for the business system the exploratory Social Network Analysis is conducted. It is found that the Polish network is fragmented and the interlocks appear mainly along companies from financial and chemical sectors. Basing on comparison with Germany it is suggested that the Polish network will be growing in size and density in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent foreign aid rents and natural resource rents can be compared with respect to their impact on economic growth. For this purpose, the direct impact of both economic rents on GDP growth, as well as their impact conditional on the quality of the institutional environment is assessed in cross-country and panel contexts. A natural resource curse is indeed identified in countries with poor institutional quality, however results regarding the impact of international aid rents are ambiguous.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Sovereign debt and CRAs: Where does the power lie?</dc:title>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Management from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>This work project analyzes how changes in sovereign debt rating within Europe can affect the stock performance of the event country, and wich are the factors that influence this impact. We found a significant impact made in both positive and negative watchlisting, while upgrades entail a significant downward reaction when they are preceded by watchlist activity. A further analysis of this impact allowed us to identify a surprise effect, composed by the presence of warning, the level of discussion and whether other agencies previously implemented the same action. Assuming the semistrong form of market efficiency holds, these findings suggestCRAs are considered to disclose provate information.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nowadays, convenience is a key dimension in the grocery retail sector. Comparing with other grocery brands, Continente is not capable of providing the same level of physical proximity to consumers. Therefore, it should make an effort to communicate that it is able to offer convenience through the Continente online store, taking advantage of the long term potential of online channels in the grocery market. New technologies have been gaining an increasing role in people’s lives and Continente has the right conditions to seize the opportunities afforded by this reality through its online sales service. In this instance, the communication strategy developed in this work aims to improve Continente online store’s functionality, communication and the promotion of its service.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Economics from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>Every year many workers fail to turn up to work due to health problems or disability. The loss of working days affects negatively individuals’ wellbeing, employers, and society in general. If on the one hand employers feel that they support most of the costs while workers are absent due to illness, on the other hand disabled employees face discrimination in labor market as employers believe that they are more likely to be absent from work. Using data from the 2005/2006 Portuguese National Health Survey, the goal of this work project is to investigate the role of health conditions on absence days reported by workers. The results, obtained from a probit model, confirm what has been found in economic literature for other countries. Disability has a positive impact on probability of absenteeism. However, in Portugal this effect is small; it amounts to a marginal increase of at most 1 day in a year.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this work project is to develop a communication strategy for Continente in order to reinforce its market leadership, mainly vis a vis Pingo Doce. From a survey conducted with a sample of 382 respondents, I perceived that shopping for food is associated with negative feelings like boredom, messiness and time consumption. The proposed strategy, tested with another quantitative survey on a sample of 120 respondents, aims to address these aspects and simultaneously increase convenience at Continente’s stores, delivering several solutions to target different consumer segments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Portugal Telecom (PT) has been in the Brazilian Telecom Market for over a decade. After the end of the Joint-Venture with Telefónica, PT and Oi, a resident telecom player, decided to combine strengths in order to create value for both companies. The success of this partnership depends on the Brazilian operator’s performance, and which competitive advantages will be possible to achieve. Portugal Telecom will receive the return under the form of dividends, firm value increase, scale and geographic projection. The key point of the partnership is the management of the integration process as it will determine whether the expertise is transferred between companies.&#13;
The project aims to analyze the motivations of the strategic partnership, the Brazilian Telecom Market, and the integration process, leading to withdrawal of final conclusions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Economics from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>This paper assesses the specialization patterns of China and India, studies the goods that are related to the core of capabilities of the countries, and then investigates the products that allow the referred countries to improve the average “income content” of their export basket. Following Hausmann et al. (2007) we compute indicators of “income content” of a country's export basket and measures of “density” which assess the likelihood of a country developing comparative advantage in one good given the current specialization pattern. The results obtained suggest that both countries are making their structural transformation into two main sectors, “Machinery” and “Chemicals, plastics, rubbers”, are becoming specialized in higher “income content” goods, and are abandoning traditional sectors like “Footwear and Clothing” and agricultural products.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Internationalization strategy of Aveleda’s Wine in the Chinese market</dc:title>

<dc:description>One of the main products which the Portuguese nation might be more competitive is the wine. Portugal has a large variety of native breeds, producing a very wide variety of different wines with distinctive personality. With all these characteristics and with the current economic context, one thing must be done: Internationalization.&#13;
Aveleda is one of the largest wine producers in Portugal and early the company’s commitment was to show their high experience and high quality of wines to the world. Therefore, the current largest producer/exporting company of VV1, a type of wine from a unique region in the world, have an undoubtedly competitive advantage in other markets. Actually, over 60% of the production is exported meaning that an increasingly investment on foreign markets will be the key for the company’s success in the long term. Casal Garcia, the most known Aveleda’s VV wine is the reflex of that and is now considered the most sold VV in the world.&#13;
Given ambitious as a SME to expand market boundaries, China will be a great opportunity due to its enormous potential of consumption and the desire of new experiences/products from the occident.&#13;
I developed an entry strategy and an Implementation Plan towards China, where the conditions are favorable for Aveleda to be a successful wine vendor in the near future, despite the impact of the current Portugal’s image not favor at all.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This empirical research is aimed to analyze the development of microfinance principles in the lending decisions of the two Chinese formal rural institutions, namely the commercial banks and credit cooperatives. For this reason, it is tested if loan purposes are oriented towards social goals, and if the guarantee requirements for the farmers are too strict. The regression results show that this implementation is only partial. Farmers have to provide too strong guarantees that they cannot afford, and this does not allow the great majority of them to get access to the credit.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Management from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>Purpose – The present study aims to understand if young consumers’ knowledge about money, covering price evaluations, opinions towards savings, allowances attribution and price-quantity judgments, is influenced by the social class, age and gender of the child.&#13;
Methodology – 249 children and parents from the 3rd and 6th grades from public and private schools participated in this study. Questionnaires were used as the main research tool.&#13;
Findings – We concluded that children from higher social classes experience fewer co-shopping activities with their parents. Concerning money knowledge, age has an impact on the accuracy of price evaluations, with older children being more precise. Moreover, it was found that as children grow, the attribution of allowances becomes more frequent, and in terms of savings, girls were shown to be more concerned. Regarding price-quantity evaluations, and as expected, older children took more time to make a purchase decision.&#13;
Research Limitations – The main limitation of this research was the narrow range of ages, and the geographic concentration of the sample in Portugal, namely Lisbon and surrounding areas.&#13;
Practical Implications – As children represent an easy target to many companies, they are constantly being blitzed through advertisements and appealing product packages. This study aims to explore what factors are responsible for the development of children’s ability to evaluate the value of goods and to make price/quantity judgments.&#13;
Value – This research deepens the knowledge about young consumers, their buying skills, and what influences their development. It is essential to enable educators and parents to support children in the development of their choice-making and buying abilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An International Strategic Plan to Brazil is the subject of this work project. The author studies the prospect of the Portuguese company Quidgest increasing its international presence. Quidgest is a software consultant that develops Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. After an extensive analysis focused on Brazil’s economy, business conjecture and its ERP market potential, the major conclusion drawn was the fact that the company should send its operations to Brazil, mainly to the state of Minas Gerais, and initiate a partnership with a consulting company already present in this country, in a Strategic Alliance arrangement.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A communication strategy for Continente: Practical, low priced and healthy eating solutions</dc:title>

<dc:contributor>Agante, Luísa</dc:contributor>
<dc:description>A Work Project, presented as part of the requirements for the Award of a Masters Degree in Management from the NOVA – School of Business and Economics</dc:description>
<dc:description>The objective of this field lab is to develop a communication strategy for Continente, a client of the communication agency FUEL, in order to respond to four trends predicted for 2012: cocooning, resistance to temptation, food loving and need to make savings.&#13;
The document begins with the situation analysis of the market in which Continente competes, for which I decided to use the Creative Business Idea (CBI) strategic process. Therefore, this analysis consists of analyzing the market momentum, which is split in three separate analyses (category momentum, prosumer momentum and brand momentum), in order to reach the creative business idea that will define the overall communication concept that I propose. To this end, I did research on the food retail sector and analyzed the trends predicted for it. Then, to understand consumers and their relation with the brand, I did open-response questions to some people and, together with 3 colleagues, developed an online survey.&#13;
Based on the market momentum, and looking specifically to the trends food loving and need to make savings, I chose to develop a communication strategy focused on low priced, practical and healthy eating solutions, more specifically, on solutions that adapt Continente’s already existing products and expand its already existing services in order to be close to customers while providing them with eating alternatives that answer to their current needs and fit in their daily routines. Consequently, after defining three different sub-concepts, I developed some proposals and organized them per sub-concept and also per Continente’s type of store.&#13;
The document ends with the strategy test and the implementation plan for my proposals. To test the strategy, I developed an online survey and made close-response questions to the human resources department of some companies. To develop the implementation plan, I analyzed the data from the answers to the online survey and close-response questions, and did research on the stores, products, and services that already exist and satisfied the needs that I propose Continente to satisfy as well.</dc:description>

<dc:description>I investigate the impact of Ishares Ibovespa Index Fund (BOVA) introduction on the liquidity of the underlying securities and the asymmetry of the liquidity effect depending on the BOVA component weight. My main finding is that there was no impact on liquidity of underlying components after the introduction of the exchange-traded fund and also that the absence of effect in liquid is symmetric for all the component securities. Additional, I find that BOVA has a low trading volume and liquidity over the 50 days of trading as compared with other ETF’s at the moment of inception. Being this the main reason for the absence of impact on the liquidity of components securities after BOVA inception.</dc:description>
